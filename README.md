Port of Clouds/Parasites/Beat Repeat to Grayscale Supercell/Microcell platform.

Note that this version has platform-specific drivers and a custom linker script and is **not** compatible with other hardware versions of Clouds.

It is based off the [Parasites codebase](https://github.com/mqtthiqs/parasites) and merges the two modes from [Beat Repeat](https://github.com/jkammerl/eurorack) for a total of eight modes:
- Granular
- Pitch shifter/time stretch
- Looping delay
- Spectral madness
- Oliverb
- Resonestor
- Beat Repeat
- Spectral clouds

As far as possible, the commit history has been preserved, for better for worse...
